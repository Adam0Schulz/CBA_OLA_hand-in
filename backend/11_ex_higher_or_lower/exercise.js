// â–ª Using if else and loops, create a javascript application that will
// 1. Randomly select a number between 1 and 100.
// 2. Ask the user for a quess (between 1 and 100)
// 3. Let the user know if the quess is higher or lower than the randomly selected
// number, and ask for a new quess, if the quess was not correct.
// 4. Let the user know that they guessed correctly and how many guesses they used,
// if the guess correctly.
